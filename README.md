# Logo Detection
A logo detection system using YOLOv5.

## Intro
Object Detection is the method of detecting objects in images or videos. Out goal here was to train a model able to detect brand logos as Starbucks, Under Armour, Nike, ... .
YoloV5 is considered to be one of the best models in terms of speed and accuracy trade-off.

## Detection Results
 -- put here some pictures with the bounding boxes --

### 1. Dataset
The dataset we deployed consists of xx images. We used Roboflow to do augmentation. We did rotation, mosaic bla bla
We trained our model to recognize the following logos: Nike, Adidas, Under Armour, Puma, The North Face, Starbucks, Apple Inc., Mercedes-Benz, NFL, Emirates, Coca-Cola, Chanel, Toyota, Pepsi, Hard Rock Caf√®.

### 2. Training
...

<a name="eval"></a>
### 3. Evaluation
We used xx different metrics to evaluate our model:
  - **IoU**
  - **mAP**

**IoU**, Intersection over Union, is an evaluation metric used to evaluate the goodness of an object detector by measuring the overlap between two bounding boxes.
**mAP**, mean Average Precision, of the model measures the Average Precision (computed by calculating the AuC for a particular class) averaged over all the classes .
**INSERT TABLES WITH THE RESULTS FOR EVERY LOGO**
